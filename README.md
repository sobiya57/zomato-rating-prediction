# 🍽️ Zomato Restaurant Rating Predictor

An end-to-end Machine Learning web application that predicts restaurant ratings based on customer behavior, pricing, and restaurant characteristics using Zomato data.

The project demonstrates the complete ML lifecycle — from data preprocessing and model training to deployment on Streamlit Cloud.

## 📌 Project Overview

Restaurant ratings play a crucial role in customer decision-making.  
This project uses historical Zomato restaurant data to predict ratings using a supervised machine learning approach.

The trained model is hosted separately using **GitHub Releases** and dynamically loaded during runtime in the Streamlit app — making the deployment lightweight and scalable.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach

- **Problem Type:** Regression  
- **Target Variable:** Restaurant Rating  
- **Model Used:** RandomForest Regressor  
- **Why RandomForest?**
  - Handles non-linear relationships well
  - Robust to outliers
  - Provides feature importance for explainability

---

## 📊 Features Used for Prediction

- Online Order Availability
- Table Booking Availability
- Restaurant Location
- Restaurant Type
- Cuisines
- Approximate Cost for Two (₹)
- Number of Customer Votes

---

## 📈 Model Explainability

The application provides **feature importance visualization** to explain:
- Why a particular rating was predicted
- Which features influenced the prediction the most

This improves transparency and trust in the ML model.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Data Analysis:** Pandas, NumPy  
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn  
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib  
- **Web App Framework:** Streamlit  
- **Model Hosting:** GitHub Releases  
- **Deployment:** Streamlit Cloud  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## ⚙️ Model Hosting Strategy

- The trained ML model is **NOT committed to GitHub**
- Instead, it is uploaded as a **GitHub Release asset**
- The Streamlit app downloads the model dynamically at runtime

✔ Prevents large file issues  
✔ Keeps repository clean  
✔ Production-friendly deployment approach
